Job Portal 
#Objective
Develop a comprehensive job portal that offers a user-friendly interface for job seekers to explore job listings and company profiles. This project focuses on front-end development with React, session management, and dynamic content rendering. The portal will include a login page connected to a previous Node.js assignment, allowing users to log in with usernames and passwords stored on the backend.

This project is a foundation that will be further improved in future assignments, so a well-organized folder structure is essential.

#Technologies Used
Front-end: React, Axios, Material UI (optional)
Back-end: Node.js, Express, JWT (for authentication)
UI Frameworks: Material UI (optional), with the option to use alternatives like Bootstrap or CSS for this assignment.


#Features
Job Listings: Users can explore job opportunities listed on the platform.
Company Profiles: Each job listing can link to a detailed company profile.
Login Page with JWT Authentication: Users log in with existing usernames and passwords, and their session is managed with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Session Management: JWT-based session management to maintain user login state.
Dynamic Content Rendering: Job listings and company profiles are dynamically fetched and displayed.
Admin and Normal User Flow using Redux: The portal includes an admin user flow and normal user flow using Redux for state management. Admin users have additional functionalities like managing users, while normal users can browse and apply for jobs.
Folder Structure
The project follows a REST API folder hierarchy with the following structure:

#bash
Copy code
/server
    /models
    /controllers
    /routes
    /services
server.js
router.js
controller.js
service.js
model.js
#File Descriptions
Server.js: The entry point of the backend server, initializing the Express app and defining middleware.
router.js: Defines the routing logic for different endpoints.
controller.js: Handles the business logic of the application.
service.js: Contains data processing logic separate from the controllers.
model.js: Defines the database schemas/models used by the app.
